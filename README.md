# 📊 Stock Market Prediction & Analytics System

An end-to-end **data-driven stock prediction project** that combines **financial analytics, data engineering, and machine learning** to predict the future closing prices of top Indian companies like **Reliance, TCS, Infosys, HDFC Bank, and ICICI Bank**.  

This project provides a complete workflow — from **data collection to predictive modeling and visualization** — serving as a foundation for **algorithmic trading, portfolio management**, and **financial data science** applications.
## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Stock Market Prediction & Analytics System** is designed to:
- Analyze **10 years of stock price data**
- Extract features like **moving averages, daily returns, and volatility**
- Predict **future closing prices** using **Linear Regression**
- Generate a **5-day price forecast**
- Visualize trends, correlations, and model performance

The system achieves an impressive **97.53% accuracy (R² Score)** and offers clear visual and analytical insights into stock behavior.

## 🧠 Key Features

✅ **Automated Data Fetching**  
Fetches 10 years of daily stock data using the **Yahoo Finance API** and saves it locally for reuse.  

✅ **Feature Engineering**  
Generates financial indicators such as:  
- **MA5, MA10, MA14, MA30** – Moving averages for trend detection  
- **Volatility** – Rolling standard deviation of returns  
- **Daily Returns** – Percent change between consecutive days  

✅ **Machine Learning Model**  
Trains a **Linear Regression** model to predict the **next day’s closing price** with:  
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE): ~12.9**  
- **R² Score: 0.9753 (97.5% accuracy)**  

✅ **5-Day Price Forecast**  
Predicts future stock prices for the **next 5 trading days** using an iterative rolling-window approach.  

✅ **Financial Data Analytics**  
Includes correlation analysis, price trend visualization, and volatility measurement.
